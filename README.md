## Structure (Model, View, Controller)
The project is divided in views, controllers and routes.
The views contain all the front-end files, where the page is created.
The controllers are where all the logics are made. They are divided in functions and each query to the API has a function in one of those controllers to be used.
The routes contain all the routes definitions, whether if they are get or post and the function in the controller they reference.

## Run the project
Use `npm run start`
